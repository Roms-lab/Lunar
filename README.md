# Lunar Language

Lunar is an upcoming, powerful programming language designed for versatility, blending the efficiency of a compiled language with the immediate feedback loop of an interpreted environment.

It is built entirely from the ground up using modern C++20, leveraging C++'s performance capabilities to deliver a reliable and high-speed execution platform.

# 🚀 Key Features
Hybrid Execution Model: Lunar offers the best of both worlds.

Interpreted Mode: Run scripts immediately for rapid prototyping and testing.

Compiled Mode: Generate optimized machine code for production deployment and maximum performance.

Built on C++20: The core interpreter and compiler infrastructure are implemented using robust, modern C++, ensuring speed, type safety, and portability.

Simple, Expressive Syntax: Designed to be intuitive and easy to read, inspired by modern scripting languages.

# 🛠️ Project Status & Development
Lunar is currently in early development. The repository showcases the initial steps of the language's core infrastructure and standard library components built in C++.

The provided C++ module Lunar demonstrates the base utility functions (Print, Input, Flush) that will form part of the language's standard library accessible via the C++ host environment.

# 📁 Core C++ Module: Lunar
The heart of the language's utility functions resides in a C++20 Module, allowing for clean imports and robust function overloading.

# 🚀 How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community! If you are interested in compiler design, interpreter development, or modern C++ programming, please check our Contributing Guidelines.

To build the current C++ infrastructure, you will need:

A C++20 compliant compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 11+, or MSVC 2022+).'

CMake (or your preferred build system).
